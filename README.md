For this program, the WASD keys are available for moving the camera forwards, backwards, and side to side. Furthermore, pressing the 'G' key once will switch the camera into a cinematic 'tour' mode, panning around the world to display the objects within it. Finally, the ground is textured with a repeating grass texture.
